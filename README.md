# iSLAT v5

**This is version v5.00 - beta release**\
*We are in the process of releasing a new version of iSLAT, version 5; here you can start testing it before its official release. Please refer to the readme file in version 4 for a general description of the tool and its functions. Please let us know of any bugs you may find!*

**Recommendation:** clone the new iSLAT in a new folder on your machine, and copy over any save files you may have made with version 4 into the respective folders (e.g. SAVES/ or LINESAVES/ or LINELISTS/). 

**Main updates from version 4:** 
- Substantial speed improvement from global refactoring of the code and data architecture
- Improved management of molecular models (now including the option to have individual RV shift and broadening)
- New function to measure line fluxes on a sample rather than on single spectrum ("Fit Saved Lines to sample")
- Several improvements to GUI organization and interactivity
