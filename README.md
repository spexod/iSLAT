# iSLAT v5

**This is version v5.00 - beta release**\
*We are in the process of releasing a new version of iSLAT, version 5; here you can start testing it before its official release (you may need to update the code from here more frequently until we officially release the new version). Please refer to the readme file in version 4 for a general description of the tool and its functions. Please let us know of any bugs you may find!*

** **RECOMMENDED**: ** clone the new iSLAT in a new folder on your machine, and copy over any save files you may have made with version 4 into the respective folders (e.g. SAVES/ or LINESAVES/ or LINELISTS/). 

**Main updates from version 4:** 
- Substantial speed improvement from global refactoring of the code and data architecture
- Improved management of molecular models (now including the option to have individual RV shift and broadening)
- New function to measure line fluxes on a sample rather than on single spectrum ("Fit Saved Lines to sample")
- Several improvements to GUI organization and interactivity
